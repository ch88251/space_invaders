## Overview

### Game Overview
Space invaders is a game where aliens fill the sky and move left and right 
across the screen. each time a row of aliens reaches either the left or 
right side of the screen the row of aliens descend to the next row.

The player controls a ship using the left and right arrow keys and fires 
lasers using the space bar. If the player ship is hit by an alien the player 
loses a ship. The player only gets 3 ships, but can earn an extra ship every 
10000 points. 

If the player shoots all the aliens before any of them reach the bottom of 
the screen, then a new level is started. In each level of the game, the aliens 
move faster. 

If the player loses all the ships the game is over.
